# XAMX
Pokémon XY/ORAS/SM/USUM script disassembly and documentation

This is a tool for dis- and re-assembling the AMX scripts in 
Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon.
<br>Documentation for how the scripts work (and other things) is found in (almost) all files, so please read them carefully.
<br>Re-assembling scripts is not yet implemented but planned™.

## Why "XAMX"?

***Pokémon X + AMX***
<br>because all of this started with a dumped Pokémon X rom, but also
<br>***Version of compiled AMX files (10) + AMX***
<br>which was just a coincidence.

## TODO

- Decompiler
- (Re-) Compiler
- Add LGPE and SwSh compatibility
