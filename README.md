Pokémon X script disassembly and documentation

This is a tool for disassembling the AMX scripts in Pokémon X.
Documentation for how the scripts work (and other things) is found in (almost) all files, so please read them carefully.
Pokémon Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Saphire have not been tested (and the latter two will most likely not work yet).
Re-assembling scripts is not yet implemented but planned™.
