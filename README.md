Pokémon X script disassembly and documentation

This is a tool for disassembling the AMX scripts in Pokémon X.
<br>Documentation for how the scripts work (and other things) is found in (almost) all files, so please read them carefully.
<br>Pokémon Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Saphire have not been tested (and the latter two will most likely not work yet).
<br>Re-assembling scripts is not yet implemented but planned™.
