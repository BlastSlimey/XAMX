This file contains the reverse-engineered command IDs. There's no guarantee for correctness.
You can contribute to this by adding more entries in the same format like you can see below.
Command names with a quote (") are custom names due to uncertainty about which actual command that ID belongs to.
Otherwise, the command name is taken from the extracted command names list.
