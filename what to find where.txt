This is purely documentation for which files contain AMX scripts and what their purpose is.

XY:
- a/0/1/2
  - Wild encounters (yes, seems like encountering a wild pokémon executes a script every time)
  - One script for every map?
- a/0/3/1
  - Seems like general overworld event scripts
  - 59 files
  - 17.bin is overworld items
  - 26.bin is hidden items
- a/0/9/0
  - unknown purpose, only first file with script?
- a/1/0/7 
  - unknown purpose, only one file
- btl_ai.garc

ORAS:
- a/0/1/3
  - Wild encounters, like in XY
- a/0/2/9
  - Seems like general overworld event scripts as well
  - 85 files
  - 31.bin is Rayquaza encounter (?) according to UPR
  - 39.bin is overworld items
- a/0/8/9
  - unknown purpose, probably the same as XY's a/0/9/0
